             <p> Identifying and recruiting outstanding senior executives without professional guidance can be a poor investment of valuable management time and resources.Consultancy provides help with this most critical of tasks. The partnership between client organization and Consultancy is on a retained basis because it reflects the essential relationship that must exist between us for the search process to be effective and to secure an outstanding candidate- the only reason for embarking on the recruitment of a senior executive as the stakes in senior executive recruitment are so high and the consequences of failure is so significant that anything less than a fully professional approach is short-sighted.</p>
            
             <p>Consultancy employs a process that has been developed over many years and is fundamental to this level of recruitment. One point of contact, exclusivity, confidentiality, partnership with the client and commitment to succeed are all critical components of retained executive search work. Our consultants will be actively involved during the recruitment process and also afterwards as they continue to be in touch with the client and the successful candidate.</p>
